# hello_world
my first git hub repository

hey everyone,

I like to design and create "green tech" by using microcontollers (arduinos). For example I am building an smart aquaponics system that I hope will be cheap enough to manufacture and be used in areas of the world that struggle with producing enough food. Anything arduino related interest me and I'd like to learn and be inspired by others on github. 

Jon
